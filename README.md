Codefi Epic Sprint 1


Thoughts: So user input validation is still on the programmer, this just makes sure the code is legit.

TS just seems like an extra layer of rules, the structure stays the same, but there are additives that keep you lined out. Intentionally preventing type bug hunting.


I can already see how interfaces and type setting can make large projects alot more streamlined. Knowing exactly how an object or data set has to be structured before hand is a huge boon.
